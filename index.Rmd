# Introduction
My really awesome and complete introduction will go here.  

# Materials and methods

Narrative and most code will go here.  Describe what you are doing and show how to do it (with code).

You can do bullets like this:

* The first most important thing
* The second most important thing
* The third most important thing

You can do numbers like this:

1. The first most important thing
2. The second most important thing
3. The third most important thing

See [http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/](http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for all the amazing things you can do.


Here's my first code chunk.
```{r}
1+2
```

Load any required packages in a code chunk (you may need to install some packages):

```{r, message=F, warning=F}
library(tidyverse)
library(leaflet)
library(kableExtra)
knitr::opts_chunk$set(cache=TRUE)  # cache the results for quick compiling
```

## Download and clean all required data
```{r}
n=20
data=data.frame(x=runif(n,-180,180),
                y=runif(n,-60,60),
                size = runif(n, 5, 20),
                category = factor(
                  sample(letters[1:5], n, replace = TRUE)
                  ),
                value = rnorm(n))
```

```{r, results='asis'}
data %>% 
  slice(1:10) %>% #show only 1:n rows
  kable(digits=2,align="c")%>% #make table and round to two digits
  kable_styling(bootstrap_options = 
                  c("striped", "hover", "condensed", "responsive")) #apply other formatting
```

Add any additional processing steps here.

# Results

Show tables, plots, etc. and describe them.

```{r, fig.width=6, fig.height=3, fig.cap="Map of completely random data"}
m <- leaflet(data) %>% 
  addTiles() %>% 
  addCircleMarkers(~x, ~y, radius = ~size,color = ~as.factor(category)) %>% 
  addPopups(~x[2], ~y[2], "Random popup")
m  # a map with the default OSM tile layer
```


```{r}
data %>% 
  ggplot(aes(x=x,y=y,col=category))+
  geom_point()
```

# Conclusions

What have you learned?  Are there any broader implications?
